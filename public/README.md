# rebirth-of-reddit

Super Awesome Co. has just been asked to concept a new Reddit theme. This is super last minute but we need to come up with a few concepts to propose to them by tomorrow. This could be huge for us and really put our shop on the map. We have to drop everything at once to hit this deadline.

Game Plan

Our game plan is to use their subreddit API to create a Reddit clone with our own theme. I know we don't have a lot of time but we also need to demonstrate that we are up to par with our stack and code quality. We can get the JSON feed of any sub-reddit by changing adding a .json extension to the URL.

Ex. http://reddit.com/r/javascript -> http://reddit.com/r/javascript.json

Objectives

Use the sub-reddit API to achieve the following:

Look at the data the API gives us and whiteboard our concept for our proposed design.
Create a simple client side application and set it up with our current workflow and create the new repo on GitHub.
Gulp
Sass
jQuery
anything else...
When the page loads we need to have the application go out to the API endpoint of your choosing to pull in the current feed via AJAX.
Dynamically create our feed list with our proposed style from the data received from the API.
Again, we have to have a good code demo as well so please use appropriate best practices when building out the app.
Set up your project as a GitHub page so that we can demo your work.
Bonus

I think it would really knock their socks off if we could have our clone have some behavior that Reddit doesn't currently have, like maybe a Twitter type of feed that updates with the latest posts or something. We'll call it Twittet or maybe Redditter...I don't know. That's what I'm paying you for!

Oh and.....THAAAAANNKKKS :D
